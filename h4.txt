Given that the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), there is strong
evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Furthermore, a 95% CI (Confidence Interval)
[54] between 2.97% & 5.70% indicates the lower and upper bound for the true average
increase in CHR (If the study were conducted with a larger population). Therefore, it
is reasonable to conclude that the increase in CHR between the two caching schemes
is not due to sampling error and is statistically significant. In the next section, we
will examine potential correlations between the cache hit ratios and some of the
demographic data.
